## How it was done 


At first, just wrote the JavaScript where it was able to play completely through the console.<br>
For player pick, prompt function is used to take the input form player. <br>
For computer pick, used random function to pick a num with the help of the number computer pick is decided.<br>
Player pick and Computer pick is compared and gets the result.<br>
